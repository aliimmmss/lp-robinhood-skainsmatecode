# Robinhood registry evidence

## Status

The Robinhood Uniswap v3 registry is **read-only verified** as of `2026-07-21T09:06:13.519Z`.

It is **not execution-eligible**. This evidence supports indexing, monitoring, and fail-closed read verification only. It does not authorize wallet connections, token approvals, calldata construction, signing, transaction submission, or capital deployment.

## Token-identity warning: two contracts named USDG

Verified 2026-07-29. **Robinhood Chain carries at least two distinct ERC-20 contracts that both report the name "Global Dollar" and the symbol `USDG`.** Both have real Uniswap v3 pools created by the pinned official factory, so factory provenance alone does not distinguish them.

| | Pinned in this registry | Second contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Address | `0x5fc5360D0400a0Fd4f2af552ADD042D716F1d168` | `0x2ce3e396e069ac9fa62046f423267072e06e77af` |
| Decimals | **6** | 18 |
| Total supply | 312,581,324 | exactly 1,000,000,000 |
| Contract verified on explorer | **yes** | **no** |
| Holders | 39,473 | 76,694 |
| WETH pool at 0.01% | `0x52e65B17…50271Ca` | `0xd84605cc215a31e4fea4f43df4d01138b3a5c6d4` |
| That pool's 24h volume | **~$149,000,000** | ~$1,078 |

Both pools are canonical results of `factory.getPool()`. The distinguishing evidence is decimals (6 matches the USDG convention used elsewhere), explorer verification, and above all trading volume: essentially all real WETH/USDG activity occurs in the pool built on the pinned contract, while the other is economically inert.

This is the concrete case the `never_identify_token_by_symbol_alone` rule exists for. Any tool that resolves USDG by symbol, or that trusts a third-party index without checking the contract address, can silently select the wrong pool. Krystal's own pool database for chain 4663 surfaces the second one, which is why its vault product cannot reach the liquid market on this chain.

Not settled: which contract is the officially sanctioned Global Dollar. Holder count favours the second; decimals, verification, and liquidity favour the pinned one. For liquidity-provision purposes the volume difference is decisive regardless, but if an authoritative publication of the canonical address is found and contradicts this registry, treat that as a fail-closed event and re-verify before acting.

## Verification record

GitHub Actions run `29816884050` compared two independently configured RPC paths:

- the official public Robinhood Chain RPC from the pinned registry
- the configured monitoring RPC, with its endpoint omitted from output

Both sources reported chain ID `4663`, agreed on every bytecode hash below, returned matching WETH/USDG pools from the pinned factory for every supported fee tier, and returned token metadata `WETH/18` and `USDG/6`.

The two sources were near the same chain tip during the audit:

- official public source: block `15442029`
- configured monitoring source: block `15442048`

## Factory results

For WETH `0x0Bd7D308f8E1639FAb988df18A8011f41EAcAD73` and USDG `0x5fc5360D0400a0Fd4f2af552ADD042D716F1d168`, both RPC sources returned the pinned pool address and code for each fee tier:

| Fee tier | Tick spacing | Factory result |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 100 | 1 | `0x52e65B17fB6E5BA00Ed806f37Afcd2DaA50271Ca` |
| 500 | 10 | `0x69BfaF19C9f377BB306a89aEd9F6B07e2c1a8d9a` |

## Running the fail-closed smoke check

After installing and building the repository:

```bash
npm run --workspace @lp-mine/robinhood-univ3 smoke:live
```

Set `ROBINHOOD_RPC_URL` to check a configured provider. Without it, the command uses the pinned official public RPC.

The command fails when:

- the chain ID differs from `4663`
- any registered contract or pool has no code
- any bytecode hash or byte length differs from the pinned evidence
- the factory returns a different or zero pool address
- a pool reports an unexpected tick spacing
- a canonical pool snapshot fails its existing immutable-metadata checks

## Factory deployment and pool creation block evidence

Verified `2026-07-23` against the official public Robinhood Chain RPC (chain ID `4663`, chain tip near block `17095011`). Two independent read-only methods were cross-checked:

1. `eth_getLogs` for the factory's constructor-emitted `OwnerChanged(address(0), owner)` event
2. `eth_getTransactionReceipt` of the emitting transaction, confirming `contractAddress` equals the pinned factory and `status` is success

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Factory deployment block | `8930` (`0x22e2`) |
| Block timestamp | `2026-05-22T17:58:26.000Z` |
| Deployment transaction | `0x8add72fbcad4bf7732336de35dcd06b582c1501d0832c4710a30850a7cff8977` |
| Block hash | `0x33e6e93cf3f8520bf51b844961e3938fd2d47013b7f0b32ed662e24cb89ac901` |
| Deployer and initial owner | `0x9701fb0ade1e269c8f64ec0c7b3cfadb31a13a52` |
| Ownership transferred at | block `31820` (`0x7c4c`) to `0x2bad8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be46cd` |

Canonical WETH/USDG `PoolCreated` events from the pinned factory, filtered by token topics. Every emitted pool address matches the pinned registry exactly:

Usage:

- `LP_MINE_START_BLOCK=8930` for `pools:scan`
- `LP_MINE_SWAP_START_BLOCK=50716` (earliest canonical pool) for `swaps:scan`

Caveats:

- This record was produced from the single official public RPC. The stricter two-provider standard used elsewhere in this document should be applied before any execution-eligible use; for read-only indexing it is sufficient because the indexer independently re-verifies pool metadata fail-closed.
- The public RPC prunes historical state (state at block `1` was unavailable), but log and receipt evidence used here does not depend on archival state.

## External explorer inconsistency

During the readiness review, indexed Blockscout page/search results classified some pinned addresses as EOAs. The direct two-source RPC audit found deployed bytecode and matching factory results at those same addresses. Explorer presentation is therefore treated as supporting context rather than execution evidence. Any future disagreement must fail closed and be re-verified from current chain state through multiple sources.

## Remaining execution blockers

No entry in this evidence registry is execution-eligible. Before a write-capable target can become eligible, issue #39 still requires:

- selection and approval of one narrowly scoped first operation
- verified source and ABI provenance
- allowed function selectors and argument policies
- upgradeability, proxy, owner, and admin-control review
- exact approval policy and revocation path
- exact-call simulation and provider-disagreement policy
- human-readable review and cancellation behavior
- receipt reconciliation and incident-disable controls

Bytecode agreement is necessary but not sufficient for execution safety.
